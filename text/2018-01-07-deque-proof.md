# Summary

This RFC proposes an implementation of concurrent work-stealing double-ended queue (deque) on
Crossbeam, and its correctness proof. this RFC has a [companion PR to `crossbeam-deque`][deque-pr].



# Motivation

We believed that the current implementation of deque is not fully optimized yet, leaving
non-negligible room for performance improvement. However, it was unclear how to further optimize the
current implementation while guaranteeing its correctness. This RFC resolves this issue by proving
an optimized implementation.



# Detailed design

In this section, we present a pseudocode of deque, and prove that (1) it is safe in the C/C++ memory
consistency model, and (2) it is functionally correct, i.e. it acts like a deque.


## Semantics of C/C++ relaxed-memory concurrency

For the semantics of C/C++ relaxed-memory concurrency on which the deque implementation is based, we
use the state-of-art [promising semantics][promising]. For a gentle introduction to the semantics,
we refer the reader to [this blog post][synch-patterns].

One caveat of the original promising semantics is its lack of support for memory allocation. In this
RFC, we use the following semantics for memory allocation:

- In the original promising semantics, a timestamp was a non-negative quotient number: `Timestamp =
  Q+`. Now we define `Timestamp = Option<Q+>`, where `None` means the location is unallocated.
  Suppose `None < Some(t)` for all `t`.

- At the beginning, the thread's view is `None` for all the locations. When a thread allocates a
  location, its view on the location becomes `0`.

- If a thread is reading a location and it's view on the location is `None`, i.e. it is unallocated
  in the thread's point of view, the behavior is undefined.

We believe this definition is compatible with all the results presented in the [paper][promising] on
the promising semantics. We hope [the Coq formalization][promising-coq] of promising semantics be
updated accordingly soon.


## Proposed implementation

A work-stealing deque is owned by the "owner" thread (`Deque<T>`), which can push items to and pop
items from the "bottom" end of the deque. Other threads, which we call "stealers" (`Stealer<T>`),
try to steal items from the "top" end of the deque. The following is a summary of its interface:

```rust
impl<T: Send> Deque<T> { // Send + !Sync
    pub fn new() -> Self { ... }
    pub fn stealer(&self) -> Stealer<T> { ... }

    pub fn push(&self, value: T) { ... }
    pub fn pop(&self) -> Option<T> { ... } // None if empty
}

impl<T: Send> Stealer<T> { // Send + Sync + Clone
    pub fn steal(&self) -> Option<T> { ... }
}
```

Chase and Lev proposed [an efficient implementation of deque][chase-lev] on sequentially consistent
memory model, and LÃª et. al. proposed [its variant for ARM and C/C++ relaxed-memory
concurrency][chase-lev-weak]. This RFC presents an even more optimized variant for C/C++.

A Chase-Lev deque consists of (1) the `bottom` index for the worker, (2) the `top` index for both
the worker and the stealers, and (3) the underlying `buffer` that contains items. When the buffer is
too small or too large, the worker may replace it with one with more appropriate size:

```rust
struct<T: Send> Inner<T> {
    bottom: AtomicUsize,
    top: AtomicUsize,
    buffer: Ptr<Buffer<T>>,
}

impl<T: Send> Inner<T> {
    ...
}
```

The `Deque` and `Stealer` structs have a counted reference to the inner implementation, and delegate
method invocations to it:

```rust
struct<T: Send> Deque<T> {
    inner: Arc<Inner<T>>,
}

impl<T:Send> Deque<T> {
    fn push(...) {
        self.inner.push(...)
    }

    ...
}

...
```

The pseudocode for `Inner<T>`'s `fn push()`, `fn pop()`, and `fn steal()` is as follows:

```rust
pub fn push(&self, value: T) {
    'L101: let b = self.bottom.load(Relaxed);
    'L102: let t = self.top.load(Acquire);
    'L103: let mut buffer = self.buffer.load(Relaxed, epoch::unprotected());

    'L104: let cap = buffer.get_capacity();
    'L105: if b - t >= cap {
    'L106:     self.resize(cap * 2);
    'L107:     buffer = self.buffer.load(Relaxed, epoch::unprotected());
    'L108: }

    'L109: buffer.write(b % buffer.get_capacity(), value, Relaxed);
    'L110: self.bottom.store(b + 1, Release);
}

pub fn pop(&self) -> Option<T> {
    'L201: let b = self.bottom.load(Relaxed);
    'L202: self.bottom.store(b - 1, Relaxed);
    'L203: fence(SeqCst);
    'L204: let t = self.top.load(Relaxed);

    'L206: if len <= 0 {
    'L207:     self.bottom.store(b, Relaxed);
    'L208:     return None;
    'L209: }

    'L210: let buffer = self.buffer.load(Relaxed, epoch::unprotected());
    'L211: let mut value = Some(buffer.read((b - 1) % buffer.get_capacity(), Relaxed));

    'L212: if len == 1 {

    'L214:         mem::forget(value.take());
    'L215:     }
    'L216:     self.bottom.store(b, Relaxed);
    'L217: } else {
    'L218:     let cap = buffer.get_capacity();
    'L219:     if len < cap / 4 {
    'L220:         self.resize(cap / 2);
    'L221:     }
    'L221: }

    'L222: value
}

fn resize(&self, cap_new) {
    'L301: let b = self.bottom.load(Relaxed);
    'L302: let t = self.top.load(Relaxed);
    'L303: let old = self.buffer.load(Relaxed, epoch::unprotected());
    'L304: let new = Buffer::new(cap_new);

    'L305: ... // copy data from old to new

    'L306: let guard = epoch::pin();
    'L307: self.buffer.store(Owned::new(new).into_shared(guard), Release);
    'L308: guard.defer(move || old.into_owned());
}

pub fn steal(&self) -> Option<T> {
    'L401: let mut t = self.top.load(Relaxed);

    'L402: let guard = epoch::pin_fence(); // epoch::pin(), but issue fence(SeqCst) even if it is re-entering
    'L403: loop {
    'L404:     let b = self.bottom.load(Acquire);
    'L405:     if b - t <= 0 {
    'L406:         return None;
    'L407:     }

    'L408:     let buffer = self.buffer.load(Acquire, &guard);
    'L409:     let value = buffer.read(t % buffer.get_capacity(), Relaxed);

    'L410:     match self.top.compare_and_swap_weak(t, t + 1, Release) {
    'L411:         Ok(_) => return Some(value),
    'L412:         Err(t_old) => {
    'L413:             mem::forget(value);
    'L414:             t = t_old;
    'L415:             fence(SeqCst);
    'L416:         }
    'L417:     }
    'L418: }
}
```


## Safety

We first prove that the proposed implementation is memory-safe, i.e. it does not invoke undefined
behavior due to illegal memory accesses. We discuss two possible causes of undefined behavior: data
race and invalid pointer dereference.


### Absence of Data Races

Every shared objects are atomically accessed so that there are no data races that invokes undefined
behavior.

In particular, the contents of the buffer is atomically accessed (`'L109`, `'L211`, `'L409`). This
is necessary because `fn push(): 'L109` and `fn steal(): 'L409` may concurrently access the contents
of the `buffer`, while the former is writing to it. For example, the scheduler may stop a `steal()`
invocation right after `'L402` so that `t` read in `'L401` may be arbitrarily stale. Now, suppose
that in a concurrent `push()` invocation, `b` equals to `t + buffer.get_capacity()` and it is
overwriting a value to `buffer`'s `(b % buffer.get_capacity())`-th element. At the same time, the
`steal()` invocation may wake up and read `buffer`'s `(t % buffer.get_capacity())`-th element.

We assume the accesses to the contents of the buffer are non-blocking. It is worth noting that the
deque's item may be arbitrarily large, and [atomic accesses to large objects are probably
blocking][cppatomic] in the C/C++11 standard library. But this really can be non-blocking, e.g. by
interpreting a relaxed store to a large object as concurrent relaxed stores to each word of the
object.


### Absence of Invalid Pointer Dereference

<!-- By invalid pointer dereference we mean (1) null pointer dereference, (2) use-after-free, or (3)
free-after-free. -->

It boils down to proving the safety of every access to the buffer pointed-to by `Inner`'s
`self.buffer`, (1) since the other shared objects, namely `self.bottom` and `self.top`, are just
integers, and (2) accesses to thread-local storage are straightforwardly safe. It is worth noting
that while the deque is shared among the owner and its stealers, only the owner is able to call `fn
push()`, `fn pop()`, and `fn resize()`, thereby modifying `self.bottom` and `self.buffer`.

After `self.buffer` is initialized, it is modified only by the owner in `fn resize(): 'L307`. Since
the contents inside a buffer is always accessed modulo the buffer's capacity (`'L109`, `'L211`,
`'L409`) and the buffer's size is always nonzero, there is no buffer overrun.

Thus it remains to prove that the buffer is not used after freed. Thanks to Crossbeam, we don't need
to take care of all the details of memory reclamation; as a user of Crossbeam, we only need to prove
that:

- When a buffer is deferred to be dropped (`'L308`), there is no longer a reference to the buffer in
  the shared memory, and no concurrent mutator introduces the reference to the memory again.

  You can easily check these properties because the owner basically "owns" the buffer: only the
  owner introduces/eliminates references to a buffer to/from the shared memory. In particular,
  before a buffer is deferred to be dropped at `'L308`, the only reference to the buffer via
  `self.buffer` is removed at `'L307`.

- With an `unprotected()` guard, we should not defer to drop an object that another thread is
  accessing, and should not access an object that another thread is deferring to drop.

  It is indeed the case because (1) a buffer is deferred to be dropped only by the owner with a
  protected guard, and (2) stealers do not use an unprotected guard.



## Functional Correctness

A more interesting question is: does the implementation act like a deque?


### Specification: Linearizability and Synchronization

In order to answer the question, we first define the sequential specification of a deque. A *deque
state* as a triple `(t, b, A)`, where `t` is the top index, `b` is the bottom index, and `A` is the
array of the values within the indexes `[t, b)`. A `push()` method invocation increases the bottom
index `b`, and push the input value at the end of `A`. A `pop()` method invocation decreases the
bottom index `b` and pop the last value from `A`, if `t < b`; otherwise, touch nothing and return
`EMPTY`. (As a special case, if `t+1 = b`, you can increase the top index `t` instead of decrease
the bottom index `b`.) A `steal()` method invocation increases the top index `t` and pop the first
value from `A`, if `t < b`; otherwise, touch nothing and return `EMPTY`. By `S -(I,R)-> S'` we
denote the described *transition relation* from a deque state `S` into `S'` by the method invocation
`I` returning `R`.

A shared object is **linearizable** as a deque if the following holds:

> Suppose that multiple threads invoked methods (i.e. `push()`, `pop()`, `steal()`) on the shared
> object in a single execution. For those invocations that is not `steal()` returning `RETRY`, there
> exists a permutation `I_1`, ..., `I_n` of them, which we call **"linearization order"**, denoted
> by `<`, and `(t_i, b_i, A_i)` for each `i` such that:
>
> - (t_0, b_0, A_0) = (0, 0, []);
>
> - (VIEW) For all `x` and `y`, if `I_x -view-> I_y`, then `x < y` holds;
>
> - (SEQ) For all `i`, `(t_i, b_i, A_i) -(signature(I_i),ret(I_i))-> (t_(i+1), b_(i+1), A_(i+1))`
>   holds. In other words, the invocations `I_1`, ..., `I_n` return outputs *as if* the methods are
>   sequentially (i.e. non-concurrently) executed to a deque one-by-one in the linearization order.

Here, by `view_beginning(j)` and `view_end(j)` we mean the thread `j`'s view at the beginning and
the end of the invocation. A view `v1` is less than or equal to another view `v2`, denoted by `v1 <=
v2`, if for any location `l`, `v1[l] <= v2[l]` holds; and `v1` is less than `v2`, denoted by `v1 <
v2`, if (1) `v1 <= v2`, and (2) there exists a location `l` such that `v1[l] < v2[l]`. By `j_x
-view-> j_y` we mean `view_end(j_x) < view_beginning(j_y)`. Also, `signature(I_i)` and `ret(I_i)`
are the function call signature and the return value of `I_i`.

In addition to linearizability, we require that a matching pair of `push()` and `steal()`
synchronize like a matching pair of a release-store and an acquire-load:

> - (SYNC) If a value is `push()`ed by an invocation `I` and then `steal()`ed by `J`, then
> `view_beginning(I) <= view_end(J)` holds.

Note that a similar property for a matching pair of `push()` and `pop()` is a corollary of
linearizability, as only the owner is able to call `push()` and `pop()` and the `push()` should be
called before the `pop()` in the "program order" (think: the execution order in a single thread).


#### View-oriented Definition of Linearizability

The condition `(VIEW)` and `(SEQ)` is a view-oriented interpretation of [the traditional definition
of linearizability][linearizability]. What is unique in `(VIEW)` is that it cannot properly
distinguish invocations with the same view. For example, suppose the client code looks like:

```rust
fn client() {
    i_1();
    i_2();
}
```

and `view_beginning(i_1) = view_end(i_1) = view_beginning(i_2) = view_end(i_2)`. By definition, `i_2
-> i_1` is a legit linearization order, yet *morally* `i_1` should be ordered before `i_2` because
it is so in the program order. However, we do not regard it a problem: if `i_1` and `i_2` do not
change the view, they are read-only, and should not change the state of the shared object. Thus it
doesn't matter whether `i_1` is considered to be before or after `i_2`.

<!-- If we want to be pedantic, we may alternatively require every method to write something to a -->
<!-- thread-local storage, effectively disallowing that the views at the beginning and the end should -->
<!-- differ. We can use this storage only in the proof, and optimize out in the runtime. -->


### Construction of Linearization Order

Consider the invocations to the deque in an execution. For the owner's invocations, the program
order is the only possible linearization among them. Let's assume that `O_0`, ..., `O_(o-1)` is the
owner's invocations, sorted according to the program order. We construct a full linearization order
by inserting stealers' invocations into it.

Note that every owner's invocation writes to `bottom`, and every stealers' invocation reads from
`bottom` at `'L404`. We classify the stealers' invocations into "groups" `{G_i}` as follows:

- For a stealer's invocation `S`, if `S` reads the initial value from `bottom`, then `S â
  G_(-1)`. Otherwise, let `O_i` be the owner's invocation that writes to `bottom` a value read by
  `S`.

- If `S` returns `EMPTY`, then `S â G_i`.

- Otherwise (i.e. `S` returns a value), let `j` be such an index that `O_(j+1)`, ..., `O_i` are
  `pop()` taking the "irregular" path (i.e. not entering `'L218`) and `O_j` is not. Then `S â G_j`.

We will insert the invocations in `G_i` between `O_i` and `O_(i+1)`. Inside a group `G_i`, we give
the linearization order as follows:

- Let `STEAL^x` be the set of steal invocations in which an element at the index `x` is stolen, and
  `STEAL_EMPTY` be the set of steal invocations in which a stealer fails to steal an element because
  the deque is empty. Let `STEAL` be `union_x {STEAL^x}`.

- Within `G_i`, place `STEAL` invocations first, and then `STEAL_EMPTY` invocations.

- If there are multiple `STEAL` invocations, order `STEAL^x` before `STEAL^y` if `x < y`.

- If there are multiple `STEAL_EMPTY` invocations, order `I` before `J` if `I -view-> J`. (Note that
  the `-view->` relation is acyclic; and there can be multiple possible linearizations.)


### Auxiliary Lemma

Let `WF_i` and `WL_i` be `O_i`'s first and last write to `bottom`.

- > (VIEW-OWNER): For arbitrary `i`, since `O_(i-1)` wrote `WF_(i-1), WL_(i-1)` and `O_i` wrote
  `WF_i, WL_i`, we have `Timestamp(WL_(i-1)) <= view_beginning(O_i)[bottom] <
  Timestamp(WF_i)`. Similarly, we have `Timestamp(WL_i) <= view_end(O_i)[bottom] <
  Timestamp(WF_(i+1))`.

- > (VIEW-STEAL): For arbitrary `i` and `S â G_i`, since `S` read `WF_i` or a later value, we have
  `Timestamp(WF_i) <= view_end(S)[bottom]`.

- > (IRREGULAR-TOP): Suppose `O_i` is `pop()` taking the irregular path. Let `x` be the value `O_i`
  read from `bottom` at `'L201`. Then [timestamp of `top = x`] <= `view_end(O_(i+1))[top]`.

  Let `y` be the value `O_i` read from `top` at `'L204`. Since `O_i` is taking the irregular path,
  we have `x-1 <= y`. If `x <= y`, then the conclusion trivially follows. If `y = x-1`, then `O_i`
  tries to compare-and-swap (CAS) `top` from `y` to `y+1` at `'L213`. Regardless of whether the CAS
  succeeds, `O_i` reads or writes a value of `top >= x`.

  It is worth nothing that for this lemma to hold, it is necessary for the CAS at `'L213` to be
  strong, i.e. it the CAS does not spuriously fail.

- > (IRREGULAR-STEAL): Suppose `O_i` is `pop()` taking the irregular path, and `S` is `steal()` that
  reads from `bottom` a value written by `O_i` and returns a value. Let `x` be the value `O_i` read
  from `bottom` at `'L201`, and `y` be the value `S` writes to `top` at `'L410`. Then `y < x` holds.

  If `S` read `bottom = x-1`, then `y <= x-1`. Otherwise, `S` read `bottom = x` written by `O_i` at
  `'L207` or `'L216`. We already know `y <= x`, so suppose `y = x` and let's derive a contradiction.

  + Case `O_i` read `top >= x` at `'L204`.

    In order for `S` to read `bottom = x` at `'L404` and `O_i` to read `top >= x` at `'L204` at the
    same time, either `S`'s write to `top` at `'L410` should be promised before reading `bottom` at
    `'L404` or `O_i`'s write to `bottom` at `'L207` should be promised before reading `top` at
    `'L204`. But this is impossible. For the former, `S`'s write to `top` at `'L410` is a
    release-store. For the latter, in order for `O_i` to promise to write `bottom = x` at `'L207`,
    `O_i` should read `top = x-1` at `'L204` and then execute the CAS at `'L213` in
    certification. But a certain future memory mandates the CAS to fail, acquiring an arbitrarily
    high view, after which it is impossible to fulfill the promise. In short, there is a semantic
    dependency from `O_i`'s read from `top` at `'L204` to `O_i`'s write to `bottom` at `'L207`.

  + Case `O_i` executes the CAS at `'L213`.

    Since `S` writes `top = x`, it is impossible that the CAS succeeds. Since the CAS is strong,
    `O_i` should have read `top >= x`. Then there is a release-acquire synchronization from `S`'s
    write to `top` at `'L410` to `O_i`'s read from `top` at `'L213`. Thus it is impossible for `S`
    to read `bottom = x` written by `O_i` at `'L216`.


### Proof of `(VIEW)`

For `(VIEW)`, it is sufficient to prove that:

1. `(VIEW-OWNER-STEAL)`: for all `i <= j` and `S â G_j`, it is not the case that `S -view-> O_i`.
2. `(VIEW-STEAL-OWNER)`: for all `i < j` and `S â G_i`, it is not the case that `O_j -view-> S`.
3. `(VIEW-STEAL-INTER-GROUP)`: for all `i < j`, `S_i â G_i` and `S_j â G_j`, it is not the case
   that `S_j -view-> S_i`.
4. `(VIEW-STEAL-INTRA-GROUP)`: for all `i` and `S, S' â G_i`, if `S` is placed before `S'`, then
   it is not the case that `S' -view-> S`.

(Note that what would be `(VIEW-OWNER-OWNER)` is obvious.)

#### Proof of `(VIEW-OWNER-STEAL)`

By `(VIEW-OWNER)` and `(VIEW-STEAL)`, we have `view_beginning(O_i)[bottom] < Timestamp(WF_i) <=
Timestamp(WF_j) <= view_end(S)[bottom]`. Thus it is not the case that `S -view-> O_i`.

#### Proof of `(VIEW-STEAL-OWNER)`

If `S` returns `EMPTY`, then `view_beginning(S)[bottom] <= Timestamp(WL_i) < Timestamp(WL_j) <=
view_end(O_j)[bottom]`. Now suppose `S` returns a value. Let `O_k` be the owner invocation that
writes to `bottom` a value read by `S` at `'L404`. Then for all `l â (i, k]`, `O_k` is `pop()`
taking the irregular path. If `k < j`, then `view_beginning(S)[bottom] <= Timestamp(WL_k) <
Timestamp(WL_j) <= view_end(O_j)[bottom]`. Now suppose `j â (i, k]`. Let `x` and `y` be the values
`O_j` read from `bottom` at `'201` and `top` at `'204`, respectively. Then we have `x-1 <= y` by the
fact that `O_j` is a `pop()` taking the irregular path, `view_beginning(S)[top] < x-1` by
`(IRREGULAR-STEAL)`, and `x <= view_end(O_j)[top]` by `(IRREGULAR-TOP)`. Thus it is not the case
that `S -view-> O_i`.

#### Proof of `(VIEW-STEAL-INTER-GROUP)`

- Case 1: `O_(i+1)`, ..., `O_j` are all `pop()` taking the irregular path.

  Then `S_j` should have returned `EMPTY`. If `S_i` read from `WF_i` or `WL_i`, then
  `view_beginning(S_i)[bottom] <= Timestamp(WL_i) < Timestamp(WF_j) <= view_ending(S_j)[bottom]`,
  and the conclusion follows. Otherwise, let `x` be the value `O_(i+1)` read from `bottom` at
  `'L201`. Then we have `view_beginning(S_i)[top] < x-1` by `(IRREGULAR-STEAL)`, and `x-1 <=
  view_end(S_j)[top]` from the fact that `S_j` read `x-1` or `x` from `bottom` at `'L404` and
  returns `EMPTY`.

- Case 2: Otherwise.

  Let `O_k` be such an invocation that is not `pop()` taking the irregular path and `k â (i,
  j]`. Then we have `view_beginning(S_i)[bottom] < Timestamp(WL_k) <= view_ending(S_j)[bottom]`, and
  the conclusion follows.

#### Proof of `(VIEW-STEAL-INTRA-GROUP)`

- Case 1: `S, S' â STEAL`.

  Suppose `S` read the value `y` from `top` at `'L401`, and `S'` read the value `w` from `top` at
  `'L401`. By the construction, `y < w`. Thus it is not the case that `S' -view-> S`.

- Case 2: `S, S' â STEAL_EMPTY`. Obvious from the construction.

- Case 3: `S â STEAL` and `S' â STEAL_EMPTY`.

  Let `b` be the value of `WL_i`; `x` and `x'` be the values `S` and `S'` read from `bottom` at
  `'L404`, respectively; and `y` and `y'` be the values `S` and `S'` read from `top` at `'L401`,
  respectively. Since `S' â STEAL`, we have `y < x`. Since `S' â STEAL_EMPTY`, we have `b-1 <= x' <=
  y'`.

  It is sufficient to prove that `y < y'` holds.

  + Case 3-1: `S` read a value from `bottom` written by `O_i`. Then `y < x = b = x' <= y'`.
  + Case 3-2: `S` read a value from `bottom` written by `O_j` for some `j > i`. Then for all `k â
              (i, j]`, `O_k` is `pop()` taking the irregular path, and we have `y+1 < b` by
              `(IRREGULAR-STEAL)`. Thus `y <= b-2 < b-1 <= x' <= y'`.


## Proof of `(SEQ)` and `(SYNC)`

Let `I_0`, ..., `I_(n-1)` be the invocations sorted according to the constructed linearization
order. In addition to `(SEQ)` and `(SYNC)`, we will simultaneously prove the following conditions
with the same existentially quantified values of `t_i, b_i, A_i`:

> `(BOTTOM)`: If `I_i` is an owner invocation, `b_i` equals to the value `I_i` read from `bottom` at
> `'L101` or `'L201`.
>
> `(TOP)`: `t_i` equals to the value of the last write to `top` in `I_0`, ..., `I_(i-1)`. Also, for
> each `x â [0,t_i)`, there is exactly one invocation in `I_0`, ..., `I_(i-1)` that performs a CAS
> that updates `top = x` to `x+1`.
>
> `(CONTENTS)`: for all `i` and `x â [t_i, b_i)`, there exists a `push()` invocation into `x` in
> `I_0, ..., I_(i-1)`; and `A_i[x]` is the value inserted by the last such invocation.

We prove that `{I_i}` satisfies `(SEQ)`, `(SYNC)`, `(BOTTOM)`, `(TOP)`, and `(CONTENTS)` by
induction on `n`: suppose `I_0`, ..., `I_(i-1)` satisfies those conditions, and let's prove that
`I_i` also satisfies those conditions. We prove for each case of `I_i`.

- Case 1: `I_i` is `push()`.

  Quite obvious.

- Case 2: `I_i` is `pop()` taking the regular path.

  Let `j` be such an index that `I_i = O_j`. Let `x` and `y` be the values `I_i` read from `bottom`
  at `'L201` and `top` at `'L204`, respectively. By `(BOTTOM)`, we have `x = b_i`. Since `I_i` is
  taking the regular path, we have `y+2 <= x`. We also prove `t_i <= y+1`. Consider the invocation
  `I` that writes `y+2` to `top`, if exists. (Otherwise, `t_i <= y+1` should obviously hold.) If `I`
  is `pop()`, then `I` should be linearized after `I_i` thanks to the coherence of `top`; if `I` is
  `steal()`, then by the synchronization of the seqcst-fences from `I_i` to `I` via `top`, the value
  `I` read from `bottom` should be coherence-after-or `WL_j`. Thus `I` is linearized after `I_i`,
  and `t_i <= y+1` holds.

  Then we have `t_i <= y+1 < y+2 <= x = b_i`, and it is legit to pop a value from the bottom end of
  the deque and decrease `bottom`.

  It remains to prove that `I_i` returns the right value. Let `O_k` be the last `push()` operation
  in `I_0`, ..., `I_(i-1)` that pushes to the index `x-1` and writes `bottom = x`, and `v` be the
  value `O_k` pushes. Thanks to `(CONTENTS)`, it is sufficient to prove that `I_i` returns `v`.

  For all `l`, let `WB_l` be the value of `buffer` at the end of the invocation `O_l`. Also, for all
  `z`, let `WC_(l, z)` be the `z`-th contents of the buffer `WB_l` at the end of the invocation
  `O_l`. They are well-defined since the pointer `buffer` and the contents of the buffer are
  modified only by the owner.

  Let's prove by induction that for all `l â [k, j)`, `WC_(l, (x-1) % size(WB_l)) = v`. Since `O_k`
  just pushed a value to the index `x-1`, it trivially holds for the base case `l = k`. Now suppose
  that it holds for `l = m` for some `m â [k, j-1)` and prove that it holds for `l = m+1`. Since
  `O_k` is the last operation that writes `bottom = x` and `I_i` writes `bottom = x-1`, `O_(m+1)` is
  not a regular `pop()` that writes `bottom = x-1`. Let `z` and `w` be the values `O_(m+1)` read
  from `bottom` at `'L301` and `top` at `'L302`, respectively, if `O_(m+1)` is resizing. Then we
  have `z >= x` by the choice of `O_k`, and `w <= y < x` by the coherence on `top`. Thus `WC_(m,
  (x-1) % size(WB_m)) = v` is copied to `WC_(m+1, (x-1) % size(WB_(m+1)))`.

  Thus `I_i = O_j` returns `WC_(j-1, (x-1) % size(WB_(j-1)))`, which equals to `v`.

- Case 3: `I_i` is `pop()` taking the irregular path.

  Let `j` be such an index that `I_i = O_j`. Let `x` and `y` be the values `I_i` read from `bottom`
  at `'L201` and `top` at `'L204`, respectively. By `(BOTTOM)`, we have `x = b_i`. Since `I_i` takes
  the irregular path, we have `y >= x-1`.

  + Case `y >= x`, or [`y = x-1` and the CAS at `'L213` fails].

    If the former is the case, then `I_i` writes `bottom = x` at `'L208`. If the latter is the case,
    then `I_i` read from `top` a value `>= x` at `'L213`, and then writes `bottom = x` at
    `'L216`. In either case, it reads `top >= x` and then writes `bottom = x`.

    We prove `x <= t_i` as follows. Consider the invocation `I` that writes `x` to `top`. If `I` is
    `pop()`, then `I` should be linearized before `I_i` thanks to the coherence of `top`. Now
    suppose `I` is `steal()`. Let `O_k` be the first `push()` invocation in `O_(j+1)`, ...,
    `O_(o-1)`. (If no such invocation exists, let `k = o`.) By the coherence of `top`, all of `O_i`,
    ..., `O_(k-1)` should be `pop()` taking the irregular path. Thus it is sufficient to prove that
    the value `I` read from `bottom` at `'L404` should be coherence-before `WF_k`. Suppose
    otherwise. Then there is a release-acquire synchronization from `WF_k` to `I`'s read from
    `bottom` at `'L404`, so `O_j`'s read from `top` at `'L204` or `'L213` is coherence-before `I`'s
    write to `top` at `'L410`. But this contradicts with the assumption.

    Thus we have `b_i = x <= t_i`, and it is legit for `I_i` to go to `'L207`, restore the original
    value of `bottom`, and return `EMPTY`.

    <!-- [I] -->
    <!-- R t x-1 -->
    <!-- ------- -->
    <!-- R b >=x -->
    <!-- U t x-1 x -->

    <!-- [I_i] -->
    <!-- R b x -->
    <!-- W b x-1 -->
    <!-- ------- -->
    <!-- R t >=x -->
    <!-- W b x -->

  + Case `y = x-1` and the CAS at `'L213` succeeds.

    `I_i` updates `top` from `x-1` to `x` at `'L213` and writes `bottom = x` at `'L216`. Let's prove
    that `x-1 <= t_i`. Consider the invocation `I` that writes `x-1` to `top`. If `I` is `pop()`,
    then `I` should be linearized before `I_i` thanks to the coherence of `top`. Suppose `I` is
    `steal()`. Let `O_k` be the first `push()` invocation in `O_(j+1)`, ..., `O_(o-1)`. (If no such
    invocation exists, let `k = o`.) By the coherence of `top`, all of `O_i`, ..., `O_(k-1)` should
    be `pop()` taking the irregular path. Thus it is sufficient to prove that the value `I` read
    from `bottom` at `'L404` should be coherence-before `WF_k`. Suppose otherwise. Then there is a
    release-acquire synchronization from `WF_k` to `I`'s read from `bottom` at `'L404`, so `O_j`'s
    write `top = x` at `'L213` is coherence-before `I`'s write `top = x-1` at `'L410`. But this
    contradicts with the assumption.

    By `(TOP)`, `x-1 <= t_i`, and the fact that `I_i` writes `x` to `top`, we have `t_i = x-1`. Thus
    `t_i = x-1 = (b_i)-1`, and it is legit to pop the value from the `bottom` end of the deque and
    increase `top`.

    `I_i` returns the right value for roughly the same reason as above.

    <!-- r t x-2 -->
    <!-- ------- -->
    <!-- r b >=x-1 -->
    <!-- u t x-2 x-1 -->

    <!-- r b x -->
    <!-- w b x-1 -->
    <!-- ------- -->
    <!-- r t x-1 -->
    <!-- u t x-1 x -->
    <!-- w b x -->

    <!-- r t x-2 -->

    <!-- e.g. -->

    <!-- [steal] -->
    <!-- r t 0 -->
    <!-- ----- -->
    <!-- r b >= 1 -->
    <!-- u t 0 1 -->

    <!-- [pop] -->
    <!-- r b 2 -->
    <!-- w b 1 -->
    <!-- ----- -->
    <!-- r t 1 -->
    <!-- u t 1 2 -->
    <!-- w b 2 -->

    <!-- [pop] -->
    <!-- r b 2 -->
    <!-- w b 1 -->
    <!-- ----- -->
    <!-- r t 2 -->
    <!-- w b 2 -->


- Case 4: `I_i` is `steal()` and it returns a value.

  Let `x` and `y` be the values `I_i` read from `bottom` at `'L404` and `top` at `'L401`,
  respectively. Then either `x = b_i` or `x = (b_i)-1` holds by the construction of linearization
  order and the definition of `push()` and `pop()`. Since `I_i` returns a value, we have `y < x`.
  let `k` be such an index that the value `I_i` reads from `bottom` at `'L404` is written by `O_k`.

  Let's prove that `y <= t_i`. Consider the invocation `I` that writes `y` to `top`. Suppose `I` is
  `pop()`. Let `j` be such an index that `I = O_j`. From the fact that `I` writes `y` to `top`, we
  know that `I` is `pop()` taking the irregular path.  Also, there is a release-acquire
  synchronization from `I`'s write to `top` at `'L213` to `I_i`'s read from `top` at `'L401-'L402`,
  and `j <= k` holds. Since `y < x`, it is not the case that `O_j`, ..., `O_k` are all `pop()`
  taking the irregular path. Thus `I = O_j` should be linearized before `I_i`, and `y <= t_i` holds.
  If `I` is `steal()`, then there is a release-acquire synchronization from `I`'s write to `top` at
  `'L410` to `I_i`'s read from `top` at `'L401-'L402`. Thus the value `I_i` read from `bottom` at
  `'L404` is the value `I` read from `bottom` at `'L404` or a later value. Thus `I` is linearized
  before `I_i`, and `y <= t_i` holds.

  Since `I_i` writes `y+1` to `top`, we have `t_i = y`. Thus we have `t_i = y <= x-1 = (b_i)-1`, and
  it is legit to steal the value from the `top` end of the deque and increase `top`.


  It remains to prove that `I_i` returns the right value. Since `I_i` reads `bottom > y`, there
  exists a `push()` invocation that pushes to the index `y` and writes `bottom = y+1`.  Let `O_k` be
  the last such an invocation in `I_0`, ..., `I_n`, and `v` be the value `O_k` pushes. Let's prove
  that `O_k` is linearized before `I_i`, and `I_i` returns `v`.

  Let's first prove that for all regular `pop()` invocation `J` that writes `bottom = y` at `'L202`,
  `J` should be linearized before `I_i`. In order for `J` to enter the regular path, `J` should have
  read from `top` a value `<= y-1`. Then by the synchronization of the seqcst-fences from `J` to
  `I_i` via `top`, the value `I_i` read from `bottom` at `'L404` is coherence-after-or the value
  written by `J` at `'L202`. This `J` is linearized before `I_i`.

  Now let's prove that `O_k` is linearized before `I_i`. If `O_k` is the only such an invocation
  that writes `bottom = y+1` at `'L110`, then the value `I_i` read from `bottom` should be
  coherence-after-or the value written by `O_k`. If there is another such invocation `O_l`, then
  there should be a regular `pop()` invocation `O_m` such that `l < m < k`, and `O_m` writes `bottom
  = y` at `'L202`. Thus `O_m` is linearized before `I_i`, and the value `I_i` read from `bottom` is
  coherence-after the value written by `O_m`. Since `I_i` should read `bottom >= y+1`, the value
  `I_i` read from `bottom` should be coherence-after-or the value written by `O_k`. In either case,
  `O_k` should be linearized before `I_i`.

  Also, for all `l > k`, `b_l > y` should hold. This is because there are no regular `pop()`
  invocations that writes `bottom = y` after `O_k`.

  <!-- [I_i] -->
  <!-- read t y -->
  <!-- -------- -->
  <!-- read b x (>= y+1) -->
  <!-- update t y y+1 -->

  <!-- [O_k: push(n)] -->
  <!-- read b y -->
  <!-- read t w -->
  <!-- write b y+1 (release) -->

  <!-- [pop(n)] -->
  <!-- read b y+1 -->
  <!-- write b y -->
  <!-- ---------- -->
  <!-- read t f (<= y-1) -->

  Let `O_l` be the owner invocation that writes `WB_l` to `buffer` that is read by `I_i`. Let `z`
  and `w` be the values `O_k` read from `bottom` at `'L101` and `top` at `'L102`, respectively.
  Since `I_i` is linearized after `O_k`, there is a release-acquire synchronization from `O_k`'s
  write to `bottom` at `'L110` to `I_i`'s read from `bottom` at `'L404`. So we have `w <= y`, `WB_l`
  is `WB_k` or a later value, and the value `v` that `O_k` wrote to the buffer at `'L109` should be
  acknowledged by `I_i` at `'L409`. Also, we have `view_beginning(O_k) <= view_end(I_i)`, as
  required by `(SYNC)`.

  + Case `l <= k`.

    Then `WB_l = WB_k`, and `I_i` read the return value from `WB_l[y % size(WB_l)]`. The read value
    should be the value `v` written by `O_k` at `'L109` or a later value. Let's think of `O_m` that
    overwrites to `WB_l[y % size(WB_l)]` after `O_k`. (If such `O_m` doesn't exist, then `I_i`
    should have read `v` and the conclusion follows.) Since `O_m` is after `O_k` and it read
    `bottom > y` at `'L101`, `O_m` is a `push()` operation that read `top > y` at `'L102`. Then
    there is a release-acquire synchronization from `I_i`'s write to `top` at `'L410` to `O_m`'s
    read from `top` at `'L102` so that `I_i`'s read from `WB_l[y % size(WB_l)]` at `'L409` happens
    before `O_m`'s write to the same location. Thus `I_i` should have read `v` at `'L409`.

  + Case `k < l`.

    Let's prove by induction that for all `m â [k, l]`, `WC_(m, y % size(WB_m)) = v`. By assumption,
    it holds for `m = k`. Now suppose that it holds for `m = n` for some `n â [k, l)` and let's
    prove that it holds for `m = n+1`. Let `f` and `g` be the values `O_(n+1)` read from `bottom`
    and `top`. Then we have `g <= w <= y < b_(n+1) = f`. Since `k < n+1`, `O_(n+1)` is not a regular
    `pop()` that writes `bottom = y`. If `O_(n+1)` is resizing, then since `g <= y < f`, `WC_(n, y %
    size(WB_n))` is copied to `WC_(n+1, y % size(WB_(n+1)))`. Thus we have `WC_(n+1, y %
    size(WB_(n+1))) = v`.

    By the release-acquire synchronization from `O_l`'s write to `buffer` at `'L307` to `I_i`'s read
    from `buffer` at `'L408`, the value `I_i` read from the buffer's content at `'L409` should be
    coherence-after-or the value `WC_(l, y % size(WB_l)) = v` that `O_l` wrote at `'L305`. Similarly
    to the above case, `I_i`'s read happens before any overwrites to the same location. Thus `I_i`
    should have read `v` at `'L409`.

  <!-- We also prove `t_i <= y` as follows. Consider the invocation `I` that writes `y+2` to `top`. If -->
  <!-- `I` is `pop()` whose last write to `bottom` is `WL_I`, then `I` should have read `y+1` from `top` -->
  <!-- at `'L213`. By positive piggybacking synchronization from `I_i`'s release-store at `'L410` to -->
  <!-- `I`'s acquire-load at `'L213`, `x` should be a value coherence-before `WL_I`. `I_i` should be -->
  <!-- linearized before `I`, and `t_i <= y` holds. If `I` is `steal()`, by positive piggybacking -->
  <!-- synchronization from `I_i`'s release-store at `'L410` to `I`'s acquire-load at `'L401-'L402`, the -->
  <!-- value `I` read from `bottom` at `'L404` should be coherence-after-or `x`. Since `I_i` writes `y+1` -->
  <!-- to `top` and `I` writes `y+2` to `top`, `I_i` should be linearized before `I`, and `t_i <= y` -->
  <!-- holds. -->


- Case 5: `I_i` is `steal()` and it returns `EMPTY`.

  Let `x` and `y` be the values `I_i` read from `bottom` at `'L404` and `top` at `'L401`,
  respectively. Since `I_i` returns `EMPTY`, `x <= y` holds. Also, either `x = b_i` or `x = (b_i)-1`
  holds by the definition of `push()` and `pop()`.

  It is sufficient to prove that `b_i <= t_i`, since then it will be legit to return `EMPTY`.

  + Case `x = b_i`.

    We prove `y <= t_i` as follows. Consider the invocation `I` that writes `y` to `top`. Suppose
    `I` is `pop()`. Let `j` be such an index that `I = O_j`. Then there is a release-acquire
    synchronization from `I`'s write to `top` at `'L213` and `I_i` read from `top` at `'L401-'L402`,
    and `x` should be coherence-after-or `WF_j`. Thus `I` should be linearized before `I_i`, and `y
    <= t_i`. If `I` is `steal()`, by a release-acquire synchronization from `I`'s write to `top` at
    `'L410` to `I_i`'s read from `top` at `'L401-'L402`, `x` should be coherence-after-or the value
    `I` read from `bottom` at `'L404`. Thus `I` should be linearized before `I_i`, and `y <= t_i`.

    Then we have `b_i = x <= y <= t_i`.

  + Case `x = (b_i)-1`.

    The value `x` should be read from `WF_j` for some `O_j` that is `pop()` taking the irregular
    path. Let `w` be the value `O_j` read from `top` at `'L204`. Since `O_j` takes the irregular
    path, we have `w >= x`.

    Let's prove that there is an invocation `I` that writes `x+1` to `top`. If `w >= x+1`, then the
    conclusion follows immediately. If `w = x`, then `O_j` tries to CAS `top` from `x` to `x+1`. It
    writes `x+1` to `top` unless if there is a concurrent `steal()` invocation that writes `x+1` to
    `top`.

    Now let's prove that `I` should be linearized before `I_i`. If `I` is `pop()`, then either `I =
    O_j` or `I` should be linearized before `O_j` by the coherence of `top`. Thus `I` is linearized
    before `I_i`. If `I` is `steal()`, then by a release-acquire synchronization from `I`'s
    release-store at `'L410` to `O_j`'s acquire-load at `'L213`, the value `I` read from `bottom` at
    `'L404` should be coherence-before `WL_j`. Thus `I` should be linearized before `O_j` and in
    turn `I_i`.

    Thus we have and `x+1 <= t_i`, and then `b_i = x+1 <= t_i`.

    <!-- [I] -->
    <!-- r t x -->
    <!-- ----- -->
    <!-- r b >=x+1 -->
    <!-- u t x x+1 -->

    <!-- [I_i] -->
    <!-- r t >=x -->
    <!-- ----- -->
    <!-- r b x -->

    <!-- O_j: -->
    <!-- r b x+1 -->
    <!-- w b x -->
    <!-- ------- -->
    <!-- r t ? -->
    <!-- w b x+1 -->



# Discussion

## Informal Proof

The proof described in this RFC is informal. We leave its formal verification in a proof assistant
as a future work.


## Comparison to the Current Implementation

A reader may notice that the pseudocode differs from [the current implementation in
Crossbeam][deque-current], which is faithfully implementing the deque described in [this
paper][chase-lev-weak]. More specifically, in the current implementation:

- `push()` issues a release fence and a relaxed write instead of a release write (`'L110`);
- `pop()` loads the buffer earlier;
- `pop()`'s CAS uses seqcst/relaxed orderings for success/failure cases instead of release/acquire
  orderings;
- `resize()` issues a release-swap to the old buffer with a new one, instead of just a release-write
  (`'L307`);
- `steal()` issues a acquire-load from `top` instead of a relaxed-load (`'L401`);
- `steal()`'s CAS uses seqcst/relaxed orderings for success/failure cases instead of release/relaxed
  orderings;
- `steal()`'s CAS is strong rather than (possibly) weak (`'L410`).

The proposed implementation is more optimized in terms of orderings, except that the CAS in `pop()`
has a stronger ordering for the failure case. But in x86, Power, and ARM architectures,
release/acquire orderings for success/failure cases for a CAS is most likely more efficient than
seqcst/relaxed orderings.


## Reasoning Out-of-thin-air Behavior

The current implementation of Chase-Lev deque is not linearizable in C11 as-is, because of so-called
"out-of-thin-air behaviors". Here is an example. Suppose that the deque consists of a single value
`42`, with `bottom = 1` and `top = 0`. Two concurrent threads access the deque. The owner thread
calls `pop()`, and the stealer thread calls `steal()` twice. Consider the following execution:

```rust
// owner calls pop()
'L01: read(bottom, 1, Relaxed)
'L02: write(bottom, 0, Relaxed)
'L03: fence(SeqCst)
'L04: read(top, 1, Relaxed) // from `'L17`
'L05: write(bottom, 1, Relaxed)
// return `Empty`

||

// stealer calls steal()
'L11: read(top, 0, Relaxed)
'L12: fence(SeqCst)
'L13: read(bottom, 0, Acquire) // from `'L02`
// return `Empty`

// stealer calls steal()
'L14: read(top, 0, Relaxed)
'L15: fence(SeqCst)
'L16: read(bottom, 1, Acquire) // from `'L05`
'L17: CAS(top, 0, 1, Release) // success
// return `42`
```

C11 allows this out-of-thin-air execution with a dependency cycle among `'L04`, `'L05`, `'L16`, and
`'L17`. But it really should not, because there is no linearization of these method invocations.
There is a [proposal to ban out-of-thin-air behaviors][n3710] in the C11 standards, but the proposal
only vaguely described what does "out-of-thin-air" mean.

You can roughly regard the promising semantics as a precise definition of out-of-thin-air
behaviors. Indeed, the promising semantics forbids this execution. See the proof of
`(IRREGULAR-STEAL)` for more details.



## Optimal Orderings

The orderings in the proposed implementation are Pareto-optimal: any lowering of any single ordering
breaks the linearizability.

In particular, the failure ordering of the CAS at `'L213` should be acquire. Without it, the
following execution is possible, but is not linearizable:

```rust
// owner calls pop()
'L01: read(bottom, 1, Relaxed)
'L02: write(bottom, 0, Relaxed)
'L03: fence(SeqCst)
'L04: read(top, 0, Relaxed)
'L05: CAS(top, 0, 1, Release) // fail; read from from `'L17`
'L06: write(bottom, 1, Relaxed)
// return `Empty`

||

// stealer calls steal()
'L11: read(top, 0, Relaxed)
'L12: fence(SeqCst)
'L13: read(bottom, 0, Relaxed) // from `'L02`
// return `Empty`

// stealer calls steal()
'L14: read(top, 0, Relaxed)
'L15: fence(SeqCst)
'L16: read(bottom, 1, Relaxed) // from `'L06`
'L17: CAS(top, 0, 1, Release) // success
// return `42`
```

Note that this example is similar to the one above, but there is no dependency from `'L05` to
`'L06`. So in order to forbid this execution, we have to ensure the ordering of `'L05` and `'L06`,
e.g. by either (1) release-write at `'L216`, (2) requiring seqcst ordering for the success case for
the CAS at `'L213` (as done in [this paper][chase-lev-weak]), or (3) requiring acquire ordering for
the failure case for the CAS at `'L213`. We chose (3), because we believe it incurs the least
performance overhead.

It is worth nothing that the CAS at `'L213` should be strong. Otherwise, a similar execution to the
one above is possible, where the CAS at `'L05` reads `top = 0` and then spuriously fails.

Even though release/acquire orderings are enough for the success/failure cases of the CAS at
`'L213`, C11 (and effectively also LLVM and Rust) requires that "The failure argument shall be no
stronger than the success argument." ([C11][c11] 7.17.7.4 paragraph 2). So we used acqrel/acquire in
the implementation instead. This C11 requirement may be fail-safe for most use cases, but can
actually be slightly inefficient in this case.


## Comparison to Target-dependent Implementations

Alternatively, we can write a deque for each target architecture in order to achieve better
performance. For example, [this paper][deque-bounded-tso] presents a variant of Chase-Lev deque in
the "bounded TSO" x86 model, where you don't need to issue the expensive `MFENCE` barrier (think:
seqcst-fence) in `pop()`. Also, [this paper][chase-lev-weak] presents a version of Chase-Lev deque
for ARMv7 that doesn't issue an `isync`-like fence, while the proposed implementation issues
some. Probably `Consume` is relevant for the latter. These further optimizations are left as future
work.
