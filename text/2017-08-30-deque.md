# Summary

This RFC proposes an implementation of work-stealing double-ended queue (deque) on Crossbeam, and
proves its correctness. FIXME(todo): this RFC has a companion PR to `crossbeam-deque`.



# Motivation

    We believe that the current implementation of deque is not fully optimized yet, leaving
non-negligible room for performance improvement. However, it is unclear how to further optimize the
current implementation while guaranteeing its correctness. We aim to resolve this issue by proving
an optimized implementation.



# Detailed design

In this section, we present a pseudocode of deque, and prove that (1) it is safe in the C/C++ memory
consistency model, and (2) it is functionally correct, i.e. it acts like a deque.


## Semantics of C/C++ relaxed-memory concurrency

For the semantics of C/C++ relaxed-memory concurrency on which the deque implementation is based, we
use the state-of-art [promising semantics][promising]. For a gentle introduction to the semantics,
we refer the reader to [this blog post][synch-patterns].

One caveat of the original promising semantics is its lack of support for memory allocation. In this
RFC, we use the following semantics for memory allocation:

- In the original promising semantics, a timestamp was a non-negative quotient number: `Timestamp =
  Q+`. Now we define `Timestamp = Option<Q+>`, where `None` means the location is
  unallocated. Suppose `None < Some(t)` for all `t`.

- At the beginning, the thread's view is `None` for all the locations. When a thread allocates a
  location, its view on the location becomes `0`.

- If a thread is reading a location and it's view on the location is `None`, i.e. it is unallocated
  in the thread's point of view, the behavior is undefined.

We believe this definition is compatible with all the results presented in the [paper][promising] on
the promising semantics. We hope [the Coq formalization][promising-coq] of promising semantics be
updated accordingly soon.


## Proposed implementation

A work-stealing deque is owned by the "owner" thread, which can push items to and pop items from the
"bottom" end of the deque. Other threads, which we call "stealers", try to steal items from the
"top" end of the deque. The following is a summary of its interface:

```rust
impl<T: Send> Deque<T> { // Send + !Sync
    pub fn new() -> Self { ... }
    pub fn stealer(&self) -> Stealer<T> { ... }

    pub fn push(&self, value: T) { ... }
    pub fn pop(&self) -> Option<T> { ... } // None if empty
}

impl<T: Send> Stealer<T> { // Send + Sync
    pub fn steal(&self) -> Option<T> { ... }
}
```

Chase and Lev proposed [an efficient implementation of deque][chase-lev] on sequential consistency,
and LÃª et. al. proposed [its variant for ARM and C/C++ relaxed-memory
concurrency][weak-chase-lev]. This RFC presents an even more optimized variant for C/C++.

Chase and Lev's implementation of deque consists of (1) the `bottom` index for the worker, (2) the
`top` index for both the worker and the stealers, and (3) the underlying `buffer` that contains
items. When the buffer is too small or too large, the worker may replace it with one with more
appropriate size:

```rust
struct<T: Send> Inner<T> {
    bottom: AtomicUsize,
    top: AtomicUsize,
    buffer: Ptr<Buffer<T>>,
}

impl<T: Send> Inner<T> {
    ...
}
```

The `Deque` and `Stealer` structs have a counted reference to the implementation, and delegate
method invocations to it:

```rust
struct<T: Send> Deque<T> {
    inner: Arc<Inner<T>>,
}

impl<T:Send> Deque<T> {
    fn push(...) {
        self.inner.push(...)
    }

    ...
}

...
```

The following is pseudocode for `Inner<T>`'s `fn push()`, `fn pop()`, and `fn steal()`:

```rust
pub fn push(&self, t: T) {
    'L101: let b = self.bottom.load(Relaxed);
    'L102: let t = self.top.load(Acquire);

    'L416:         }
    'L417:     }
    'L418: }
}
```


## Safety

We first prove that the implementation is memory-safe, i.e. it does not invoke undefined behavior
due to illegal memory accesses. We discuss two possible causes of undefined behavior: data race and
invalid pointer dereference.


### Presence of Data Races

In the C/C++ standard, if two threads race on a non-atomic object, i.e. they concurrently access it
and at least one of them writes to it, then the program's behavior is undefined. Unfortunately, in
fact, `fn push(): 'L107` and `fn steal(): 'L408` may race on `buffer`. For example, the scheduler
may stop a `steal()` invocation right after `'L402` so that `t` read in `'L401` may be arbitrarily
stale. Now, suppose that in a concurrent `push()` invocation, `b` equals to `t +
buffer.get_capacity()` and it is overwriting a value to `buffer`'s `(b % buffer.get_capacity())`-th
element. At the same time, the `steal()` invocation may wake up and read `buffer`'s `(t %
buffer.get_capacity())`-th element, incurring a data race with the `push()`.

In order to avoid this data race, we may use an atomic buffer. However, the deque's item may be
arbitrarily large, and [atomic accesses to large objects are most likely blocking][cppatomic], which
is highly undesirable. Thus there is a genuine data race in Chase and Lev's deque w.r.t. the C/C++
standards.

We make a rather bold claim: **data races are NOT undefined behavior**, but a racing reader may read
an unspecified value (or the `poison` value in the LLVM lingo), and racing writers may write each
word of values in any order. This is the specification on racy accesses of promising semantics,
except that the semantics currently doesn't specify the behavior of multi-word accesses.


### Absence of Invalid Pointer Dereference

<!-- By invalid pointer dereference we mean (1) null pointer dereference, (2) use-after-free, or (3)
free-after-free. -->

It boils down to proving the safety of every access to the buffer pointed-to by `Inner`'s
`self.buffer`, (1) since the other shared objects, namely `self.bottom` and `self.top`, are just
integers, and (2) accesses to thread-local storage are straightforwardly safe. It is worth noting
that while the deque is shared among the owner (`Deque<T>`) and its stealers, only the owner is able
to call `fn push()`, `fn pop()`, and `fn resize()`, thereby modifying `self.bottom` and
`self.buffer`.

After `self.buffer` is initialized, it is modified only by the owner in `fn resize(): 'L307`. Since
elements inside a buffer is always accessed modulo the buffer's capacity (`'L109`, `'L211`, `'L409`)
and the buffer's size is always nonzero, there is no buffer overrun.

Thus it remains to prove that the buffer is not used after freed. Thanks to Crossbeam, we don't need
to take care of all the details of memory reclamation; as a user of Crossbeam, we only need to prove
that:

- When a buffer is deferred to be dropped (`'L308`), there is no longer a reference to the buffer in
  the shared memory, and no concurrent mutator introduces the reference to the memory again.

  You can easily check these properties because the owner basically "owns" the buffer: only the
  owner introduces/eliminates references to a buffer to/from the shared memory. In particular,
  before a buffer is deferred to be dropped at `'L308`, the only reference to the buffer via
  `self.buffer` is removed at `'L307`.

- With an `unprotected()` guard, we should not defer to drop an object that another thread is
  accessing, and should not access an object that another thread is deferring to drop.

  It is indeed the case because (1) a buffer is deferred to be dropped only by the owner with a
  protected guard, and (2) stealers do not use an unprotected guard.



## Functional Correctness

A more interesting question is: does it act like a deque?

### Specification: Linearizability and Synchronization

In order to answer the question, we first define the sequential specification of a deque. A *deque
state* as a triple `(t, b, A)`, where `t` is the top index, `b` is the bottom index, and `A` is the
array of the values within the indexes `[t, b)`. A `push()` method invocation increases the bottom
index `b`, and push the input value at the end of `A`. A `pop()` method invocation decreases the
bottom index `b` and pop the last value from `A`, if `t < b`; otherwise, touch nothing and return
`EMPTY`. (As a special case, if `t+1 = b`, you can increase the top index `t` instead of decrease
the bottom index `b`.) A `steal()` method invocation increases the top index `t` and pop the first
value from `A`, if `t < b`; otherwise, touch nothing and return `EMPTY`. By `S -(I,R)-> S'` we
denote the described *transition relation* from a deque state `S` into `S'` by the method invocation
`I` returning `R`.

A shared object is **linearizable** as a deque if the following holds:

> Suppose that multiple threads invoke methods (i.e. `push()`, `pop()`, `steal()`) on the shared
> object in a single execution. Then there exists a permutation `I_1`, ..., `I_n` of those
> invocations, which we call **"linearization order"**, denoted by `<`, and `(t_i, b_i, A_i)` for
> each `i` such that:
>
> - (VIEW) For all `x` and `y`, if `I_x -view-> I_y`, then `x < y` holds;
>
> - (SEQ) For all `i`, `(t_i, b_i, A_i) -(signature(I_i),ret(I_i))-> (t_(i+1), b_(i+1), A_(i+1))`
>   holds. In other words, the invocations `I_1`, ..., `I_n` return outputs **as if** the methods
>   are sequentially (i.e. non-concurrently) executed to a deque one-by-one in the linearization
>   order.

Here, by `view_beginning(j)` and `view_end(j)` we mean the thread `j`'s view at the beginning and
the end of the invocation. A view `v1` is less than or equal to another view `v2`, denoted by `v1 <=
v2`, if for any location `l`, `v1[l] <= v2[l]` holds; and `v1` is less than `v2`, denoted by `v1 <
v2`, if (1) `v1 <= v2`, and (2) there exists a location `l` such that `v1[l] < v2[l]`. By `j_x
-view-> j_y` we mean `view_end(j_x) < view_beginning(j_y)`. Also, `signature(I_i)` and `ret(I_i)`
are the function call signature and the return value of `I_i`.

In addition to linearizability, we require that a matching pair of `push()` and `steal()`
synchronize like a matching pair of a release-store and an acquire-load:

> - (SYNC) If a value is `push()`ed by an invocation `I` and then `steal()`ed by `J`, then
> `view_beginning(I) <= view_end(J)` holds.

Note that a similar property for a matching pair of `push()` and `pop()` is a corollary of
linearizability, as only the owner is able to call `push()` and `pop()` and the `push()` should be
called before the `pop()` in the program order.


#### Comparison of the Definition of Linearizability

The condition `(VIEW)` and `(SEQ)` is a view-oriented interpretation of a similar condition in the
[the traditional definition of linearizability][linearizability]. What is unique in `(VIEW)` is that
it cannot properly distinguish invocations with the same view. For example, suppose the client code
looks like:

```rust
fn client() {
    i_1();
    i_2();
}
```

and `view_beginning(i_1) = view_end(i_1) = view_beginning(i_2) = view_end(i_2)`. By definition, `i_2
-> i_1` is a legit linearization order, yet morally `i_1` should be ordered before `i_2` because it
is so in the _program order_ (think: the execution order in a single thread). However, we do not
regard it a problem: if `i_1` and `i_2` do not change the view, they are read-only, and should not
change the state of the shared object. Thus it doesn't matter whether `i_1` is considered to be
before or after `i_2`.

<!-- If we want to be pedantic, we may alternatively require every method to write something to a -->
<!-- thread-local storage, effectively disallowing that the views at the beginning and the end should -->
<!-- differ. We can use this storage only in the proof, and optimize out in the runtime. -->


### Construction of Linearization Order

Consider the invocations to the deque in an execution. For the owner's invocations, the program
order is the only possible linearization among them. Let's assume that `O_0`, ..., `O_(o-1)` is the
owner's invocations, sorted according to the program order. We construct a full linearization order
by inserting stealers' invocations into it.

Note that every owner's invocation writes to `bottom`, and every stealers' invocation reads from
`bottom`. We classify the stealers' invocations into "groups" `{G_i}` as follows:

- For a stealer's invocation `S`, if `S` reads from the initial value of `bottom`, then `S â
  G_(-1)`.

- Otherwise, let `O_i` be the owner's invocation that writes to `bottom` a value which `S` read.

- If `O_i` is a `push()`, `O_i` is a `pop()` taking the "normal" path (i.e. entering `'L218`), or
  `S` returns `EMPTY`, then `S â G_i`; otherwise, then `S â G_(i-1).`


We will insert the invocations in `G_i` between `O_i` and `O_(i+1)`. Inside a group `G_i`, we give
the linearization order as follows:

- Let `STEAL^x` be the set of steal invocations in which an element at the index `x` is stolen, and
  `STEAL_EMPTY` be the set of steal invocations in which a stealer fails to steal an element because
  the deque is empty. Let `STEAL` be `union_x {STEAL^x}`.

- Within `G_i`, place `STEAL` invocations first, and then `STEAL_EMPTY` invocations.

- If there are multiple `STEAL` invocations, order `STEAL^x` before `STEAL^y` if `x < y`.

- If there are multiple `STEAL_EMPTY` invocations, order `I` before `J` if `I -view-> J`. (Note that
  `-view->` relation is acyclic; and there can be multiple possible linearizations.)


### Proof of `(VIEW)`

For `(VIEW)`, it is sufficient to prove that:

1. `(VIEW-OWNER-STEALER)`: for all `i <= j` and `S â G_j`, it is not the case that `S -view-> O_i`.
2. `(VIEW-STEALER-OWNER)`: for all `i < j` and `S â G_i`, it is not the case that `O_j -view-> S`.
3. `(VIEW-STEALER-INTER-GROUP)`: for all `i < j`, `S_i â G_i` and `S_j â G_j`, it is not the case
   that `S_j -view-> S_i`.
4. `(VIEW-STEALER-INTRA-GROUP)`: for all `i` and `S, S' â G_i`, if `S` is placed before `S'`, then
   it is not the case that `S' -view-> S`.

(Note that what would be `(VIEW-OWNER-OWNER)` is obvious.) 

#### Auxiliary Lemma

Let `WF_i` and `WL_i` be `O_i`'s first and last write to `bottom`.

For arbitrary `i`, since `O_(i-1)` wrote `WF_(i-1), WL_(i-1)` and `O_i` wrote `WF_i, WL_i`, we have
`Timestamp(WL_(i-1)) <= view_beginning(O_i)[bottom] < Timestamp(WF_i)`. Similarly, we have
`Timestamp(WL_i) <= view_end(O_i)[bottom] < Timestamp(WF_(i+1))`.

For arbitrary `i` and `S â G_i`, since `S` read `WF_i` or a later value, we have `Timestamp(WF_i) <=
view_end(S)[bottom]`. Also, since `S` read `WL_(i+1)` or an earlier value, we have
`view_beginning(S)[bottom] <= Timestamp(WL_(i+1))`.

Suppose `O_i` is a `pop()` not taking the normal path, and `S` is a `steal()` that reads from
`bottom` a value written by `O_i` and returns a value. Let `x` be the value of `bottom` read by
`O_i` at `'L201`, and `y` be the value of `top` written by `S` at `'L410`. Then `y < x` holds. The
reason is as follows. If `S` read `x-1` from `bottom`, then `y <= x-1`. Now suppose `S` read from
`bottom` the value `x` written by `O_i` at `'L207` or `'L216`. We already know `y <= x`, so suppose
`y = x` and let's derive a contradiction. Then `O_i` should have read from `top` a value `>= x` at
`'L204` or `'L213`. But this is impossible: in order for `S` to read `bottom = x` at `'L404` and
`O_i` to read `top >= x` at `'L204` or `'L213` at the same time, either `S`'s write to `top` at
`'L410` should be promised before reading `bottom` at `'L404` or `O_i`'s write to `bottom` at
`'L207` (or `'L216`) should be promised before reading `top` at `'L204` (or `'L213`, respectively),
but the former is release-store and the latter has a control dependency to the read from `top`. (It
is worth nothing that here is the only place where promises are explicitly reasoned about: in all
other places, it's enough to think of only views.)


#### Proof of `(VIEW-OWNER-STEALER)`.

Since `view_beginning(O_i)[bottom] < Timestamp(WF_i) <= Timestamp(WF_j) <= view_end(S)[bottom]`, it
is not the case that `S -view-> O_i`.

#### Proof of `(VIEW-STEALER-OWNER)`.

We have `view_beginning(S)[bottom] <= Timestamp(WL_(i+1)) <= Timestamp(WL_j) <=
view_end(O_j)[bottom]`. If `view_beginning(S)[bottom] < view_end(O_j)[bottom]`, then it is not the
case that `O_j -view-> S`.

Now suppose otherwise. Then we have `j = i+1` and `view_beginning(S)[bottom] = Timestamp(WL_(i+1)) =
view_end(O_(i+1))[bottom]`, so `S` read `bottom` from `WL_(i+1)` and returns a value and `O_(i+1)`
is a `pop()` that does not take the normal path.  Let `x` be the value `O_(i+1)` read from `bottom`
at `'L201`. Since `S` wrote a value less then `x` to `top` and `O_(i+1)` does not take the normal
path, we have `view_beginning(S)[top]` < [the timestamp of `top = x`] <=
`view_end(O_(i+1))[top]`. So it is not the case that `O_(i+1) -view-> S`.

#### Proof of `(VIEW-STEALER-INTER-GROUP)`.

We have `view_beginning(S_i)[bottom] <= Timestamp(WL_(i+1))` and `Timestamp(WF_j) <=
view_end(S_j)[bottom]`. Thus if either `i+1 < j`, `view_beginning(S_i)[bottom] <
Timestamp(WF_(i+1))` or `Timestamp(WL_j) < view_end(S_j)[bottom]` holds, then it is not the case
that `S_j -view-> S_i`.

Now suppose otherwise. Then `j = i+1`, `O_(i+1)` is a `pop()` that does not take the normal path,
`S_i` and `S_j` both read from `bottom` values written in `O_(i+1)`, `S_i` returns a value, and
`S_j` returns `EMPTY`. Let `x` be the value of `bottom` read by `O_(i+1)` at `'L201`, and `y` be the
value of `top` written by `S`. Then `y < x` holds. So we have `view_beginning(S_i)[top]` < `y` <=
`x-1` <= `view_end(S_j)[top]`, and it is not the case that `S_j -view-> S_i`.

#### Proof of `(VIEW-STEALER-INTRA-GROUP)`.

Case 1: `S, S' â STEAL`. 

Suppose `S` read the value `y` from `top` at `'L401`, and `S'` read the value `w` from `top` at
`'L401`. By the construction, `y < w`. Thus it is not the case that `S' -view-> S`.

Case 2: `S, S' â STEAL_EMPTY`. Obvious from the construction.

Case 3: `S â STEAL` and `S' â STEAL_EMPTY`. 

Let `b` be the value of `WL_i`, `x` and `y` be the value `S` read from `bottom` at `'L404` and `top`
at `'L401`, respectively, and `z` and `w` be the value `S'` read from `bottom` at `'L404` and `top`
at `'L401`, respectively. Since `S` and `S'` are in `G_i`, [`x = b` or `x = b-1`] and [`z = b` or `z
= b-1`] holds (since `S` may read from `bottom` written by `O_i` or non-normal `pop()` invocation
`O_(i+1)`). From the fact that `S` succeeded in stealing a value, we have `y < x <= b` and thus `y
<= b-1`; similarly, from the fact that `S'` failed in stealing a value, we have `w >= z >= b-1`.

We prove `y < w` by contradiction. Suppose otherwise: `w <= y`. Then we have `b-1 <= w <= y <= b-1`,
and thus `y = w = b-1`, `x = b`, and `z = b-1`. Thus `S` read `bottom ` from `O_i`, and it is not
the case that `O_i` is a `pop()` not taking the normal path. Then `S` and `S'` should have read the
single value written by `O_i` and `x = z` should hold, which contradicts with the fact that `x = b`
and `z = b-1`.

The conclusion follows from the fact that `y` is coherence-before `w`.



## Proof of `(SEQ)` and `(SYNC)`

Let `I_0`, ..., `I_(n-1)` be the invocations sorted according to the constructed linearization
order. In addition to `(SEQ)` and `(SYNC)`, we will simultaneously prove:

> `(CONTENT)`: for all `i` and `x â [t_i, b_i)`, there exists a `push()` invocation into `x` in
> `I_0, ..., I_(i-1)`; and `A_i[x]` is the value inserted by the last such invocation.
>
> `(TOP)`: `t_i` equals to the value of the last write to `top` in `I_0`, ..., `I_(i-1)`.

These conditions should be satisfied with the same existentially quantified values of `t_i, b_i,
A_i` with `(SEQ)` and `(SYNC)`.

We prove that `{I_i}` satisfies `(SEQ)`, `(SYNC)`, `(CONTENT)`, and `(TOP)` by induction on `n`:
suppose `I_0`, ..., `I_(i-1)` satisfies those conditions, and let's prove that `I_i` also satisfies
those conditions. We prove for each case of `I_i`.

- Case 1: `I_i` is `push()`.

  Quite obvious.

- Case 2: `I_i` is `pop()`, and it takes the "normal path" (`len >= 2` and goes to `'L218`).

  Let `x` be the value `I_i` read from `bottom` at `'L201`, and `y` be the value `I_i` read from
  `top` at `'L204`. Then we have `x = b_i`, as `bottom` is modified only by the writer. We also
  prove `t_i <= y+1`. Consider the invocation `I` that writes `y+2` to `top`, if exists. (Otherwise,
  `t_i <= y+1` should obviously hold.) If `I` is `pop()`, then `I` should be linearized after `I_i`
  thanks to the coherence of `top`; if `I` is `steal()`, by positive piggybacking synchronization of
  the SC fences from `I_i` to `I` via `top`, `I` should load a value that is coherence-after-or
  `WL_i` from `bottom`.  Thus `I â G_j` for some `j >= i` and `I` is linearized after `I_i`. Thus
  `t_i <= y+1` holds.

  Since `I_i` takes the normal path, we have `t_i - 1 <= y <= x-2 = b_i - 2`, and thus `t_i <
  b_i`. So it is legit to pop a value from the bottom end of the deque and decrease `bottom`.
  
  FIXME: the right value?

- Case 3: `I_i` is `pop()`, and it doesn't take the normal path.

FIXME(revised so far)

  Let `x` be the value `I_i` read from `bottom` at `'L201`, and `y` be the value `I_i` read from
  `top` at `'L204`. Similarly to the above case, we have `x = b_i`. We also prove `y <= t_i` as
  follows. Consider the invocation `I` that writes `y` to `top`. If `I` is `pop()`, then `I` should
  be linearized before `I_i` thanks to the coherence of `top`; if `I` is `steal()`, by positive
  piggybacking synchronization from `I`'s release-store at `'L410` to `I_i`'s acquire-load at
  `'L204`, the value `I` read from `bottom` at `'L404` should be coherence-before `WL_i`. So `I â
  G_j` for some `j < i`, and thus `I` is linearized before `I_i`.

  If `x <= y`, then `I_i` goes to `'L207`, restores the original value of `bottom`, and returns
  `EMPTY`. It is legit because we have `b_i = x <= y <= t_i`.

  Otherwise, since `I_i` doesn't take the normal path, it went to `'L213` so that `x = y+1`.

  If the (strong) compare-and-swap (CAS) at `L213` fails, then there should be a succeeding
  `steal()` invocation `I` such that writes `y+1` to `top`. Then by positive piggybacking
  synchronization from `I`'s release-store at `'L410` to `I_i`'s acquire-load at `'L213`, the value
  `I` read from `bottom` at `'L404` should be coherence-before `WL_i` written at `'L216`. (Here, it
  is important that the CAS at `'L213` is strong.) So `I â G_j` for some `j < i`, and thus `I` is
  linearized before `I_i`. Which means `y+1 <= t_i`, and thus `b_i = x = y+1 <= t_i`. Thus it is
  legit to return `EMPTY`.

  Now suppose the CAS at `'L213` succeeds. Let's prove that `t_i <= y`. Consider the invocation `I`
  that writes `y+2` to `top`, if exists. (Otherwise, `t_i <= y` should obviously hold.) If `I` is
  `pop()`, then `I` should be linearized after `I_i` thanks to the coherence of `top`; if `I` is
  `steal()`, by positive piggybacking synchronization of the SC fences from `I_i` to `I` via `top`,
  `I` should load a value that is coherence-after-or `WF_i` from `bottom`. However, it cannot be
  `WF_i` because `Value(WF_i) = x-1 = y`, while `I` should load a value `>= y+2`. Thus `I â G_j` for
  some `j >= i` and `I` is linearized after `I_i`. Thus `t_i <= y` holds. Then `t_i <= y < y+1 = x =
  b_i`, and it is legit to steal the value from the `top` end of the deque and increase `top`.

  FIXME: the right value?

- Case 4: `I_i` is `steal()` and it returns a value.

  Let `x` be the value `I_i` read from `bottom` at `'L404`, and `y` be the value `I_i` read from
  `top` at `'L401`. Then either `x = b_i` or `x = b_i - 1` holds by the definition of the owner
  methods `push()` and `pop()`.

  We also prove `t_i <= y` as follows. Consider the invocation `I` that writes `y+2` to `top`. If
  `I` is `pop()` whose last write to `bottom` is `WL_I`, then `I` should have read `y+1` from `top`
  at `'L213`. By positive piggybacking synchronization from `I_i`'s release-store at `'L410` to
  `I`'s acquire-load at `'L213`, `x` should be a value coherence-before `WL_I`. `I_i` should be
  linearized before `I`, and `t_i <= y` holds. If `I` is `steal()`, by positive piggybacking
  synchronization from `I_i`'s release-store at `'L410` to `I`'s acquire-load at `'L401-'L402`, the
  value `I` read from `bottom` at `'L404` should be coherence-after-or `x`. Since `I_i` writes `y+1`
  to `top` and `I` writes `y+2` to `top`, `I_i` should be linearized before `I`, and `t_i <= y`
  holds.

  Then we have `t_i <= y < x <= b_i`, and it is legit to steal the value from the `top` end of the
  deque and increase `top`.

  FIXME: the right value?

- Case 5: `I_i` is `steal()` and it returns `EMPTY`.

  Let `x` be the value `I_i` read from `bottom` at `'L404`, and `y` be the value `I_i` read from
  `top` at `'L401`. Then `x <= y` holds since `I_i` returns `EMPTY`. Also, either `x = b_i` or `x =
  b_i - 1` holds by the definition of the owner methods `push()` and `pop()`. 
  
  It is sufficient to prove that `b_i <= t_i`, since it will be legit to return `EMPTY`.

  + Case `x = b_i`.

    We prove `y <= t_i` as follows. Consider the invocation `I` that writes `y` to `top`. If `I` is
    `pop()` and `I = O_j`, then there is a positive piggybacking synchronization from `I`'s
    release-store at `'L213` and `I_i`'s acquire-load at `'L401-'L402`, and `x` should be
    coherence-after-or `WF_j`. Thus `I` should be linearized before `I_i`, and `y <= t_i`. If `I` is
    `steal()`, by positive piggybacking synchronization from `I`'s release-store at `'L410` to
    `I_i`'s acquire-load at `'L401-'L402`, `x` should be coherence-after-or the value `I` read from
    `bottom` at `'L404`. Thus `I` should be linearized before `I_i`, and `y <= t_i`.

    Then we have `b_i = x <= y <= t_i`.

  + Case `x = b_i - 1`.
  
    The value `x` should be read from `WF_j` for some `O_j` that is not taking the normal path in
    `pop()`. Let `z` be the value `O_j` read from `top` at `'L204`. Since `O_j` did not take the
    normal path, we have `z >= x`. 
    
    Let's prove that there is an invocation `I` that writes `y+1` to `top`. If `z >= x+1`, then the
    conclusion follows. If `z = x`, then `O_j` tries to CAS `top` from `x` to `x+1`. It writes `y+1`
    to `top` unless if there is a concurrent `steal()` invocation that writes `y+1` to `top`.

    Now let's prove that `I` should be linearized before `I_i`. If `I` is `pop()`, then either `I =
    O_j` or `I` should be linearized before `O_j` by the coherence of `top`. Thus `I` is linearized
    before `I_i`. If `I` is `steal()`, then by the positive piggybacking synchronization from `I`'s
    release-store at `'L410` to `O_j`'s acquire-load at `'L213`, the value `I` read from `bottom`
    should be coherence-before `WL_j`. Thus `I` should be linearized before `O_j` and in turn `I_i`.

    Thus we have and `y+1 <= t_j`, and in turn `b_i = x+1 <= y+1 <= t_i`.



# Alternatives

## The current implementation

A reader may notice that the pseudocode differs from [the current implementation in
Crossbeam][current-impl]. FIXME: We believe the current implementation is buggy w.r.t. the C11
memory model, because it uses SC updates that do not provide the interleaving property. See [RFC
#6][rfc6] for more details.

## Target-dependent implementation

Alternatively, we can write a deque for each target architecture in order to achieve better
performance. Indeed, [this paper][FIXME] presented a variant of Chase and Lev's deque which issues
less `MFENCE` in `fn FIXME()` than the x86 compilation result of the proposed implementation. Also,
a variant in [this paper][weak-chase-lev] for POWER doesn't issue an `isync` fence, while the
proposed implementation issues one. These further optimizations are left as future work.

FIXME: discuss the bugs we found on prior work



# Unresolved questions

Is it *really* the most efficient implementation in the C11 memory model?

FIXME(todo): Chase-Lev is not linearizable in C11, but it is in the promising semantics.

Is there any soundness gap in the description above? More ambitiously, can we formally verify the
correctness of the proposed implementation?
